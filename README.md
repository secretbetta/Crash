# Command Line Shell

See: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/cs326/assignments/project-2.html

My program works, supposedly. It is supposed to be a custom shell, crafted by the hands of yours truly. The shell is actually pretty straightforward. You run the program and you can run system commands with a couple of built in commands, such as cd, exit, history, setenv, set.

cd - it changes you to a different directory

exit - leaves the program

history - you can see what commands you've previously put in and if you use something like !39 it'll run the 39th command you ran

setenv - it sets an environment variable

set - you can see all your environment variables


How to build: make

How to run: ./crash
