## About This Project

### What is a shell?
The shell is the command interpretor in an operating system such as Unix or GNU/Linux, it is a program that executes other programs. It provides a computer user an interface to the Unix/GNU Linux system so that the user can run different commands or utilities/tools with some input data.

### Running the program
```bash
>$ make 
>$ ./crash
```

### Included Files
There are several files included. These are:
   - <b>Makefile</b>: Including to compile and run the program.
   - <b>shell.c</b>: The program driver
   - <b>builtin.c</b>: Built in functions
   - <b>ui.c</b>: The user interface of the shell
   - <b>history.c</b>: Includes functions that will record, print, and show command history.
   - <b>util.c</b>: Includes helper functions to read in a file using system call read and also tokenize a string.

Hello World!
[ðŸ™‚|2|anguyen27@anguyen27VM ~/Projects/P2-secretbetta]$ cd tests
[ðŸ™‚|3|anguyen27@anguyen27VM ~/Projects/P2-secretbetta/tests]$ cd ..
[ðŸ™‚|4|anguyen27@anguyen27VM ~/Projects/P2-secretbetta]$ history
 1 echo Hello World!
 2 cd tests
 3 cd ..
 4 history
[ðŸ™‚|5|anguyen27@anguyen27VM ~/Projects/P2-secretbetta]$ #this is a comment :D
[ðŸ™‚|6|anguyen27@anguyen27VM ~/Projects/P2-secretbetta]$ ./not a cmd
Execvp: No such file or directory
[ðŸ˜­|7|anguyen27@anguyen27VM ~/Projects/P2-secretbetta]$
```

## Testing

To execute the test cases, use `make test`. To pull in updated test cases, run `make testupdate`. You can also run a specific test case instead of all of them:

```
# Run all test cases:
make test

# Run a specific test case:
make test run=4

# Run a few specific test cases (4, 8, and 12 in this case):
make test run='4 8 12'
```
